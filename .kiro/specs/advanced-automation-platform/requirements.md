# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of EchoAI SaaS from a basic Q&A chatbot into a comprehensive, intelligent automation platform. The system will provide advanced multi-modal capabilities, persistent conversation memory, visual workflow automation, and deep integrations with business tools. The goal is to create a sticky, indispensable product that automates complex business processes while maintaining the existing MVP functionality.

## Requirements

4. WHEN a conversation exceeds the memory window THEN the system SHALL maintain a rolling buffer of recent exchanges
5. IF a user returns after a session break THEN the system SHALL resume the conversation using the stored conversation_id
6. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL link conversations to users via email identification

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Multi-Tab Chat Widget
