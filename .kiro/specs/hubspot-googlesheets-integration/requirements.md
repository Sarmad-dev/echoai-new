# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables seamless integration with HubSpot and Google Sheets platforms within the workflow automation system. When users add HubSpot or Google Sheets nodes to their workflows, the system will automatically validate the connection and retrieve user account information to ensure proper authentication and data access. This integration enhances the user experience by providing immediate feedback on connection status and displaying relevant account details for configuration purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow builder, I want to add HubSpot nodes to my automation workflows, so that I can integrate CRM data and operations into my business processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a HubSpot node to their workflow THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate a connection validation process
2. WHEN the HubSpot connection validation is successful THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display the user's HubSpot account information
3. WHEN the HubSpot connection validation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting guidance
4. IF the user has not previously authenticated with HubSpot THEN the system SHALL prompt them to complete the OAuth authentication flow
5. WHEN the HubSpot account information is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display relevant details such as account name, portal ID, and available permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow builder, I want to add Google Sheets nodes to my automation workflows, so that I can read from and write to spreadsheets as part of my data processing tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a Google Sheets node to their workflow THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate a connection validation process
2. WHEN the Google Sheets connection validation is successful THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display the user's Google account information
3. WHEN the Google Sheets connection validation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting guidance
4. IF the user has not previously authenticated with Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL prompt them to complete the OAuth authentication flow
5. WHEN the Google account information is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display relevant details such as email address, available spreadsheets access, and quota information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow builder, I want immediate feedback on my integration connections, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any authentication or permission issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connection validation process begins THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with appropriate messaging
2. WHEN connection validation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success indicator with account details within 5 seconds
3. WHEN connection validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error information and suggested remediation steps
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL provide a clear call-to-action button to initiate the OAuth flow
5. WHEN OAuth authentication is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically retry the connection validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow builder, I want to see my account information for connected services, so that I can verify I'm using the correct accounts and understand available permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HubSpot account information is displayed THEN the system SHALL show portal name, portal ID, user email, and subscription tier
2. WHEN Google Sheets account information is displayed THEN the system SHALL show user email, available storage quota, and sheets access permissions
3. WHEN account information is outdated or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide an option to refresh the connection
4. WHEN multiple accounts are available for a service THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which account to use
5. WHEN account permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate what additional permissions are needed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want connection validation to be secure and efficient, so that user credentials are protected and the system performs well under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption methods
2. WHEN making API calls for validation THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting to avoid service quotas
3. WHEN connection validation fails due to rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh them before prompting for re-authentication
5. WHEN handling sensitive user data THEN the system SHALL comply with data privacy regulations and minimize data retention

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow builder, I want consistent behavior across different integration types, so that I have a predictable experience when working with various services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding any supported integration node THEN the system SHALL follow the same connection validation pattern
2. WHEN displaying account information THEN the system SHALL use consistent UI components and layouts
3. WHEN handling authentication errors THEN the system SHALL provide standardized error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN managing multiple integrations THEN the system SHALL provide a unified interface for viewing and managing all connections
5. WHEN updating integration configurations THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent validation and feedback mechanisms
