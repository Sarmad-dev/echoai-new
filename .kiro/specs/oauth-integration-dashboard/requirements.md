# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the implementation of a dedicated dashboard route page for OAuth integrations, specifically focusing on Slack and HubSpot connections. The feature will provide users with an intuitive interface to connect their external accounts through secure OAuth flows, manage existing connections, and monitor integration status. This builds upon the existing EchoAI SaaS platform to enhance the automation capabilities with third-party service integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Integration Dashboard Route

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to access a dedicated integrations page in my dashboard, so that I can easily manage all my third-party service connections in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/dashboard/integrations` THEN the system SHALL display the integrations dashboard page
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show available integration options for Slack and HubSpot
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the current connection status for each integration
4. WHEN an integration is connected THEN the system SHALL show connection details including connected account name and connection date
5. WHEN an integration is not connected THEN the system SHALL show a "Connect" button for that service
6. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL use proper loading states while fetching integration status

### Requirement 2: Slack OAuth Integration Flow

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to connect my Slack workspace to the automation platform, so that I can send automated messages and notifications to my team channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Connect Slack" button THEN the system SHALL initiate the Slack OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
2. WHEN the OAuth flow starts THEN the system SHALL redirect me to Slack's authorization page with proper scopes
3. WHEN I authorize the application on Slack THEN the system SHALL receive the authorization code via callback
4. WHEN the callback is processed THEN the system SHALL exchange the authorization code for access tokens
5. WHEN tokens are received THEN the system SHALL securely store the encrypted access and refresh tokens
6. WHEN the connection is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect me back to the integrations page with success feedback
7. WHEN the connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and allow retry
8. WHEN Slack is connected THEN the system SHALL display the connected workspace name and connection status

### Requirement 3: HubSpot OAuth Integration Flow

**User Story:** As a sales manager, I want to connect my HubSpot CRM to the automation platform, so that I can automatically create contacts and deals from chat interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Connect HubSpot" button THEN the system SHALL initiate the HubSpot OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
2. WHEN the OAuth flow starts THEN the system SHALL redirect me to HubSpot's authorization page with required scopes
3. WHEN I authorize the application on HubSpot THEN the system SHALL receive the authorization code via callback
4. WHEN the callback is processed THEN the system SHALL exchange the authorization code for access tokens
5. WHEN tokens are received THEN the system SHALL securely store the encrypted access and refresh tokens
6. WHEN the connection is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect me back to the integrations page with success feedback
7. WHEN the connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and allow retry
8. WHEN HubSpot is connected THEN the system SHALL display the connected portal name and connection status

### Requirement 4: OAuth Security and Token Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want OAuth tokens to be securely managed and automatically refreshed, so that integrations remain functional without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing OAuth tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt all access and refresh tokens before database storage
2. WHEN tokens are retrieved THEN the system SHALL decrypt them securely for API calls
3. WHEN access tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens
4. WHEN refresh token flow fails THEN the system SHALL mark the integration as disconnected and notify the user
5. WHEN OAuth state parameters are used THEN the system SHALL validate state to prevent CSRF attacks
6. WHEN handling OAuth callbacks THEN the system SHALL validate the authorization code and state parameters
7. WHEN storing integration data THEN the system SHALL associate it with the correct user account

### Requirement 5: Integration Management Interface

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to manage my connected integrations, so that I can disconnect services or reconnect them when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing connected integrations THEN the system SHALL display connection status, account details, and last sync time
2. WHEN I want to disconnect an integration THEN the system SHALL provide a "Disconnect" button
3. WHEN I click "Disconnect" THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before proceeding
4. WHEN I confirm disconnection THEN the system SHALL revoke tokens and remove the integration from the database
5. WHEN an integration is disconnected THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show "Connect" button again
6. WHEN I want to reconnect a service THEN the system SHALL allow me to go through the OAuth flow again
7. WHEN integration status changes THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback to the user

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when OAuth flows succeed or fail, so that I understand the status of my integration attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth authorization is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message with integration details
2. WHEN OAuth authorization fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages explaining the failure
3. WHEN network errors occur during OAuth THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages and retry options
4. WHEN the user cancels OAuth authorization THEN the system SHALL handle the cancellation gracefully
5. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user that reconnection is required
6. WHEN API calls to integrated services fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide user-friendly messages
7. WHEN displaying errors THEN the system SHALL provide actionable next steps for resolution

### Requirement 7: Integration Status Monitoring

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to monitor the health of my integrations, so that I can ensure my automations are working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the integrations page THEN the system SHALL display the health status of each connected integration
2. WHEN an integration is healthy THEN the system SHALL show a green status indicator
3. WHEN an integration has issues THEN the system SHALL show a warning or error status indicator
4. WHEN integration health checks run THEN the system SHALL test API connectivity and token validity
5. WHEN health status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI in real-time
6. WHEN integration errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
7. WHEN viewing integration details THEN the system SHALL show last successful API call timestamp
