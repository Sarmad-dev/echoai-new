# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with integration connection status and field visibility in the automation platform. Currently, users are experiencing problems where Slack shows as "not connected" despite successful account connection, and there's no way to view available fields from connected HubSpot and Google Sheets accounts. This enhancement will improve the reliability of connection status checking and provide users with visibility into available fields from their connected accounts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with connected integrations, I want to see accurate connection status for all my integrations, so that I can trust the system and troubleshoot connection issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has successfully connected their Slack account THEN the system SHALL display "Connected" status with team and user information
2. WHEN a Slack connection test fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages to help with troubleshooting
3. WHEN a user has successfully connected their HubSpot account THEN the system SHALL display "Connected" status with portal information
4. WHEN a user has successfully connected their Google Sheets account THEN the system SHALL display "Connected" status with user email information
5. WHEN any integration connection test fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user configuring automation workflows, I want to see all available fields from my connected HubSpot account, so that I can properly map data and configure actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a connected HubSpot integration THEN the system SHALL display all available contact properties with their labels and types
2. WHEN a user has a connected HubSpot integration THEN the system SHALL display all available deal properties with their labels and types
3. WHEN a user has a connected HubSpot integration THEN the system SHALL display all available company properties with their labels and types
4. WHEN HubSpot properties are displayed THEN the system SHALL group them by object type (contacts, deals, companies)
5. WHEN HubSpot properties fail to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user configuring automation workflows, I want to see all available spreadsheets and sheets from my connected Google Sheets account, so that I can select the correct destination for my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a connected Google Sheets integration THEN the system SHALL display all accessible spreadsheets with names and modification dates
2. WHEN a user selects a spreadsheet THEN the system SHALL display all available sheets within that spreadsheet
3. WHEN a user selects a sheet THEN the system SHALL display column headers if available
4. WHEN Google Sheets data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
5. WHEN displaying spreadsheets THEN the system SHALL provide search and filtering capabilities for large lists

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing integrations, I want enhanced connection testing that validates both authentication and permissions, so that I can ensure my integrations will work properly in workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Slack connection THEN the system SHALL verify bot permissions and channel access
2. WHEN testing HubSpot connection THEN the system SHALL verify CRM object access permissions
3. WHEN testing Google Sheets connection THEN the system SHALL verify both Sheets and Drive API access
4. WHEN connection tests pass THEN the system SHALL cache results for improved performance
5. WHEN connection tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user building workflows, I want integration nodes to show connection status and available fields inline, so that I can configure actions without leaving the workflow builder.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a Slack action node THEN the system SHALL display connection status and available channels
2. WHEN adding a HubSpot action node THEN the system SHALL display connection status and relevant object properties
3. WHEN adding a Google Sheets action node THEN the system SHALL display connection status and available spreadsheets/sheets
4. WHEN an integration is not connected THEN the system SHALL provide a direct link to connect the integration
5. WHEN integration data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for integration issues, so that I can troubleshoot problems and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration connection tests fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN token refresh is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt token refresh before failing
4. WHEN integration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages while logging technical details
5. WHEN integration health changes THEN the system SHALL update status in real-time without requiring page refresh
