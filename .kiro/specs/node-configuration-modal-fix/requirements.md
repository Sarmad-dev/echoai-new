# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical user experience issue where the node configuration modal closes unexpectedly when users type in form input fields. The modal should remain open and stable during form interactions, allowing users to complete their configuration without interruption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user configuring a workflow node, I want the configuration modal to remain open when I type in input fields, so that I can complete my configuration without the modal closing unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a node configuration modal THEN the modal SHALL remain open until explicitly closed by the user
2. WHEN a user types in any input field within the modal THEN the modal SHALL NOT close automatically
3. WHEN a user changes any form field value THEN the modal SHALL maintain its open state
4. WHEN a user clicks outside the modal THEN the modal SHALL close (standard modal behavior)
5. WHEN a user clicks the close button or presses ESC THEN the modal SHALL close

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my form input changes to be preserved and not cause the modal to reset, so that I don't lose my configuration progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in an input field THEN the input value SHALL be preserved without causing component re-renders
2. WHEN form state changes THEN the parent component SHALL NOT re-render in a way that unmounts the modal
3. WHEN the modal is open THEN form state changes SHALL be handled locally within the modal component
4. IF the modal closes and reopens THEN previously entered values SHALL be restored from the configuration state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the modal state management to be properly isolated from form state changes, so that form interactions don't affect modal visibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing modal components THEN modal open/close state SHALL be managed independently from form state
2. WHEN form inputs change THEN the modal container component SHALL NOT re-render
3. WHEN using React state for form inputs THEN state updates SHALL be optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. WHEN the modal is rendered THEN it SHALL use stable component references to prevent unmounting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent modal behavior across all node configuration types (HubSpot, Google Sheets, Slack), so that I have a predictable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring any integration node type THEN the modal behavior SHALL be consistent
2. WHEN switching between different configuration sections THEN the modal SHALL remain stable
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed without closing the modal
4. WHEN loading states change THEN the modal SHALL remain open and show appropriate loading indicators
