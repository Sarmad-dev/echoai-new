# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the enhancement of the existing chatbot system to transform it from a simple document-based Q&A system into an intelligent, conversational AI assistant. The enhanced chatbot will support custom training instructions, proactive decision-making, lead qualification, conversation escalation, memory awareness, and an improved user interface with streaming responses and better visual design. The system will maintain all existing functionality while adding sophisticated conversational intelligence and enhanced user experience features.
