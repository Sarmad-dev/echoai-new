# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses inconsistency in Slack action node configuration within the automation workflow builder. Currently, the "Send Slack Message" action node properly checks Slack connection status and loads available channels and users during configuration, but the "Send Slack Notification" and "Send Slack Thread Reply" action nodes do not perform these same checks. This enhancement will standardize the configuration experience across all Slack action nodes to ensure consistent connection validation and data loading.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user configuring Slack notification actions, I want the system to check my Slack connection status and load available channels and users, so that I have the same consistent configuration experience across all Slack action types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a "Send Slack Notification" action node THEN the system SHALL check the Slack connection status before showing configuration options
2. WHEN the Slack connection is verified THEN the system SHALL load and display available channels in the configuration dropdown
3. WHEN the Slack connection is verified THEN the system SHALL load and display available users in the configuration dropdown
4. WHEN the Slack connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a connection error message with a link to connect Slack
5. WHEN loading channels and users THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states during data fetching

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user configuring Slack thread reply actions, I want the system to check my Slack connection status and load available channels and users, so that I can properly configure thread replies with the same experience as other Slack actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a "Send Slack Thread Reply" action node THEN the system SHALL check the Slack connection status before showing configuration options
2. WHEN the Slack connection is verified THEN the system SHALL load and display available channels in the configuration dropdown
3. WHEN the Slack connection is verified THEN the system SHALL load and display available users in the configuration dropdown
4. WHEN the Slack connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a connection error message with a link to connect Slack
5. WHEN loading channels and users THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states during data fetching

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user configuring any Slack action, I want consistent error handling and retry mechanisms across all Slack action types, so that I have a reliable configuration experience regardless of which Slack action I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Slack API calls fail during configuration THEN the system SHALL display consistent error messages across all Slack action types
2. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and inform the user
4. WHEN connection tests succeed THEN the system SHALL cache results for improved performance across action types
5. WHEN displaying error states THEN the system SHALL provide actionable remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all Slack action configuration forms to use shared connection checking and data loading logic, so that the code is maintainable and consistent behavior is guaranteed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Slack action configuration forms THEN the system SHALL use shared utility functions for connection checking
2. WHEN loading Slack channels THEN all action types SHALL use the same API endpoint and data structure
3. WHEN loading Slack users THEN all action types SHALL use the same API endpoint and data structure
4. WHEN handling connection errors THEN all action types SHALL use the same error handling patterns
5. WHEN displaying loading states THEN all action types SHALL use consistent UI components and messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with multiple Slack integrations, I want all Slack action configuration forms to properly handle integration selection and validation, so that I can configure actions for the correct Slack workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple Slack integrations exist THEN all action configuration forms SHALL display integration selection options
2. WHEN an integration is selected THEN the system SHALL validate the integration status before loading channels and users
3. WHEN an integration is inactive THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warnings and prevent configuration
4. WHEN switching between integrations THEN the system SHALL reload channels and users for the selected integration
5. WHEN no integrations exist THEN the system SHALL display setup instructions consistently across all action types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user configuring Slack actions, I want the same channel and user selection interface across all Slack action types, so that I have a familiar and consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting channels THEN all Slack action forms SHALL use the same dropdown component with consistent formatting
2. WHEN selecting users THEN all Slack action forms SHALL use the same dropdown component with consistent formatting
3. WHEN displaying channels THEN the system SHALL show channel names with # prefix consistently
4. WHEN displaying users THEN the system SHALL show usernames with @ prefix and email addresses when available
5. WHEN searching channels or users THEN all action forms SHALL provide the same search and filtering capabilities
